# Principles of Design

## Principles of Design

* The protocol must be *simple* enough for multiple implementations to
  be developed, but simplicity is not the only factor.
* The protocol must be *functional* enough to support a wide range of
  applications beyond just social media.
* The protocol should not impede high-performance high-throughput
  implementations.
* It is ok to do things multiple ways if there are very compelling reasons to
  do so. Every additional way to do something that is required to be supported
  by all software thus further burdens all software, and that cost must be
  well justified.
* Code that isn't required by everybody should be defined outside of the
  core specification.

[Rationale](rationale.md) used for various decisions is available in an
appendix.
