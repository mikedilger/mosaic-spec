* `[0:2]` - The type 0x1 as a little-endian encoded unsigned integer
* `[2:3]` - The length 0x25
* `[3:8]` - Zeroed
* `[8:40]` - public key (32 bytes)

Records with this tag indicate that the record is of interest to the
person identified by that public key (as their master key).  Being tagged
as such, it SHOULD be delivered to all of this persons' INBOX servers as
specified in their [bootstrap](bootstrap.md) record.

This is a reply to another record in a threading sense.

`KIND` is an 8-byte record [kind](kinds.md) indicating the kind of record
that this one replies to. Replies are application-independent and MAY
reference records of any type. This information is provided to prevent
lookup of records of kinds that software is not able to or does not wish
to handle.

`REFERENCE` is a 48-byte [reference](reference.md) to some other record
indicating which other record this record replies to.

If a record includes this tag, it MUST also include a
[Root](#root) tag as well.

* `[0:2]` - The type 0x3 as a little-endian encoded unsigned integer
* `[2:3]` - The length 0x35
* `[3:8]` - Zeroed
* `[8:16]` - The [kind](kinds.md)
* `[16:64]` - The reference (48 bytes)

This indicates the root of the reply thread. This is to support loading
an entire thread in one round trip.

`KIND` is a 8-byte record [kind](kinds.md) indicating the kind of record
that the root record is. Threads are application-independent and MAY
reference records of any type. This information is provided to prevent
lookup of records of kinds that software is not able to or does not wish
to handle.

`REFERENCE` is a 48-byte [reference](reference.md) to some other record
which is the root of the thread.

If a record includes this tag, it MUST also include a
[Reply](#reply) tag as well.

* `[2:3]` - The length 0x25
* `[3:8]` - Zeroed
* `[8:40]` - The Nostr ID (32 bytes)

For dual-stack clients that produce Nostr events alongside Mosaic records,
and who want to track replies on sister events in nostr as well as here in
Mosaic, this is a pointer to the sister event in nostr.

NOTE: The nostr sister event will have a "mosaic" tag that contains the
hex of the id of its Mosaic sister record.

## Subkey

* `[2:3]` - The length 0x25
* `[3:8]` - Zeroed

This is used only on [key schedule](keyschedule.md) records so that clients
can look up a subkey to verify it's association to a master key.

Note that this is different from a [Notify Public Key](#notify-public-key) tag
which indicates the record should be delivered to that person.  Instead, this
tag indicates that a `@name` for the person SHOULD be rendered when rendering
the content.
