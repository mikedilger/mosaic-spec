# Status and Development

## Versions and Attribution

Many people are expected to contribute to Mosaic and as a result there are
various divergent viewpoints as to how Mosaic ought to be. As a result, we
label this edition as the Mike Dilger edition. You will see this at the
bottom of every page. Other Mosaic contributors can fork this and maintain
their own editions. The community will eventually settle on something
because people want to be compatible.

Version 0.1 is a pre-feature-complete version, developed by Mike Dilger.

Starting from version 0.2, all pre-1.0 versions will be feature-complete but
not stabilized or frozen. Feedback from the community will be applied as
the draft standard improves from this community feedback. During this time,
deployments should be considered experimental as they will likely break and
no effort will be made to support their quirks when 1.0 is frozen.

Version 1.0 will be the first stabilized and frozen release. All future
versions are intended to support it for backwards compatibility.
