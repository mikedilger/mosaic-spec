# Application Registry

| Application |  ID   | Link |
|-------------|-------|------|
| Mosaic Core |     0 | this document |
| Mosaic Social Media |    1 | this document |
| Examples |    99 | unspecified |

Applications are specified separately from Mosaic, except for <t>Mosaic Core</t> and
<t>Mosaic Social Media</t>.

Application IDs are 4-byte unsigned integers.

Application IDs outside of this Mosaic spec SHOULD be selected randomly to avoid
the chance of collision with other applications that have not registered their ID
with us.

External groups may define applications and have their Application ID registered here.
We would appreciate knowing about your application, and listing it here both further
avoids collision risk, and advertises its availability.
