Mosaic is a *work in progress*.  This specification is incomplete and an early draft.

NOTE: When you see a <t>superscript</t> [<sup>rat</sup>](rationale.md), the "rat" is a link
to the rationale behind this. Rationale is kept so we can remember why decisions were
made, but kept separate to not clutter the specification.
